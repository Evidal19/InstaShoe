# InstaShoe

## Purpose

On the homepage of InstaShoe, the an individual will first see the heading with the page title along with an enourmous, aesthetic image of a pair of Nikes tennis shoes. Once the said person scrolls down, he will see multiple posts of shoes that users can buy. Each post consists of a picture of the shoe, a post title, a post decription, the price of the shoes, a comment button, and a buy button. 

When an individual click on the comment button, the person will be directed to the comments page. If the individual wants to make a comment, then he will need to create an account on the registration page. Once he creates the account, the new user will be redirected to the login page. After logging in, the user will have access to his own dashboard via the selection menu on the left. In the dashboard, the user will be able to make, editm or delete posts. He will also be able to see which shoe's he has sold. He can also make a post from the 'Create Post' page, which can be found on the aforementioned selection menu.
